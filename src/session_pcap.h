// the only such transition, and it wipes the ring) read_chunk() returns 0 for
// the remainder so the response truncates cleanly.
//
// Design decision: Record wins over an in-flight download rather than being
// refused. The download can be retried; the user's intent to start a fresh
// capture is higher priority than preserving a stale byte stream. The
// download-in-progress counter is tracked so state transitions can observe it
